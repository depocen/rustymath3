# About this Booklet {-}

This booklet serves as the text for self-learning to be updated continuously.   

Why use R for this purpose? It would be more natural to use symbolic math software, such as *Mathematica* [@Wolfram2003] or *Maple* [@Liengme2019], but (1) this software is expensive, and although there are free, open-source alternatives, they are not, in my experience, as easy to use;^[But check out the free *Wolfram Alpha* website at <\url{https://www.wolframalpha.com/}>. You can enter commands in the same "Wolfram" language used by *Mathematica* as well as "natural-language" queries. For example, the expressions `D[4x^3 + 12x^2 - 3x - 2, x]` and `differentiate 4x^3 + 12x^2 - 3x - 2` evaluate $\frac{d}{dx}(4x^3 + 12x^2 - 3x - 2)$---and simplify the resulting function, graph it, find its roots, and more.]   (2) R has excellent linear algebra and graphics capabilities, along with a full range of statistical distributions; (3) readers can also use R for statistical data analysis---which is its principal purpose---and may already be familiar with it; (4) R is free, open-source software, and is simple to use for the computations performed in the text; (5) finally, I used R to produce almost all of the graphs in the text.

In addition to the basic R distribution, this document uses several add-on packages that, like R itself, are freely available from the *Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)* at <\url{https://cran.r-project.org/}>: **car** [@FoxWeisberg2019], **matlib** [@FriendlyFoxChalmers2020], **mosaicCalc** [@KaplanPruimHorton2020], **mvtnorm** [@GenzEtAl2020], and **RcmdrMisc** [@Fox2020a]. These packages can be installed via the R command `install.packages(c("car", "matlib", "mosaicCalc", "mvtnorm", "RcmdrMisc))`.

This document assumes some familiarity with R. For the basics, see the manual *An Introduction to R*, which is distributed with R and is also available in various formats on the CRAN website. For a more extensive introduction to R in the context of applied regression analysis, see @FoxWeisberg2019. 

This supplement to the *Math Primer** is available both in PDF format and as an *R Markdown* document (`R-supplement.Rmd`), which can be conveniently edited and compiled in the *RStudio* interactive development environment for R [see, in particular, @XieAllaireGrolemund2019]. *RStudio* is free, open-source (though commercially developed) software, available along with extensive documentation at <\url{https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/}>. The R commands in the document are also in a stand-alone R script (`R-supplement.R`).

### Python codes fragment 

From time to time, `Python code` will also be presented to faciliate my own learning.
